# Employee Database Analysis

In this project, we will be working with a fictional company called Pewlett Hackard to analyze employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. The goal is to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks using SQL.


It has been two weeks since I've been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task is to conduct a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.


The work is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling
Inspect CSV files: Inspect the CSV files provided and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables. You can use tools like QuickDBD for this purpose.

## Data Engineering

Create table schema: Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Import CSV files: Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
List employee details: List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List employees hired in 1986: List the first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.

List department managers: List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List employee departments: List the department number for each employee along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

Search for specific employees: List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List employees by department: List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List employees by multiple departments: List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List frequency counts of employee last names: List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name).
