SQL Challenge: Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, the task is to conduct a research project on employees who were employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The employee database from that period consists of six CSV files. The project involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis to answer questions about the data.

Data Modeling:

Inspected the CSV files and sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using tools like QuickDBD.
Ensured the ERD includes all necessary tables and relationships.

Data Engineering:

Created table schemas for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table in the correct order, handling foreign keys appropriately.
Data Analysis:

List employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department with department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List department number for each employee along with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List first name, last name, and sex of employees named Hercules with last names starting with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including employee number, last name, and first name.
List employees in the Sales and Development departments, including employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the frequency counts of all employee last names in descending order.

Results:

Data modeling: An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to visualize table structures and relationships.
Data engineering: Table schemas were defined for each CSV file, and data was imported into corresponding SQL tables.
Data analysis: SQL queries were executed to retrieve required information from the database based on specified criteria.

Conclusion:
The SQL challenge involved designing table schemas, importing data, and performing data analysis on the Pewlett Hackard employee database. By following the instructions and executing SQL queries, insights into employee data from the 1980s and 1990s were obtained, facilitating further analysis and decision-making processes.
